Most teams discover trends **after** they’ve already peaked.

ZoomSignals exists to spot **repeatable creative patterns** early — not viral one-offs, not dashboards, and not hindsight analysis.

This post explains how to *read* the signals in this feed and how to use them responsibly.

## What is a Creative Signal?

A creative signal is a **recurring format or execution pattern** that appears independently across multiple brands or ads within a short time window.

This could be:
- A structure (e.g. “problem → POV → punchline”)
- A framing device (e.g. founder selfie confession)
- A production choice (e.g. static captions + jump cuts)

What matters is **repetition with intent**, not reach.

## Understanding the Metrics

Each signal is tagged with four key indicators. Together, they answer one question:

> *Is this worth testing right now?*

### 1. Confidence

Confidence reflects **how sure we are** that the pattern is real.

- **High** → seen repeatedly across brands/platforms  
- **Medium** → emerging but still consolidating  
- **Low** → early observation, directional only  

---

### 2. Velocity

Velocity explains **how fast adoption is happening**.

- Emerging → early sightings  
- Accelerating → adoption increasing rapidly  
- Stable → usage plateaued  
- Declining → signal fading  

For example, this signal is currently accelerating:

### 3. Status (Lifecycle)

Status tells you *where the signal sits in its lifecycle*:

- EARLY → opportunity window  
- PEAKING → effective but competitive  
- SATURATED → likely diminishing returns  

This helps avoid late-stage copycat execution.

## How to Use This Feed

ZoomSignals is **not** a performance tool.

Use it to:
- Inform creative briefs  
- Pressure-test new ideas  
- Validate intuition with pattern evidence  

Do **not** use it to:
- Blindly copy formats  
- Replace experimentation  
- Predict outcomes

## Final Thought

Signals don’t replace strategy — they **sharpen timing**.

The goal isn’t to be first.  
It’s to be *early enough*.
