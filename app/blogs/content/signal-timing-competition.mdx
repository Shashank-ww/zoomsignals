Creative performance rarely collapses because of bad ideas.

It declines because of bad timing.

Signals appear in phases. Acting too early wastes budget. Acting too late wastes differentiation.

This guide explains how to time your response.



## The Three Phases of a Signal

Every repeatable creative pattern moves through a predictable curve:

### 1. Formation

- Seen in a small cluster of accounts
- Often category-specific
- Performance impact still directional

This is observation territory — not scaling territory.



### 2. Acceleration

- Cross-category adoption begins
- Platform algorithms amplify structure
- Competitive density still low

This is the window most teams miss.

If your category is underrepresented, this is often the moment to test aggressively.



### 3. Saturation

- Heavy adoption
- Platform familiarity reduces novelty
- CPC efficiency begins compressing

At this stage, execution quality matters more than format novelty.



## The Strategic Question

When reviewing a signal, ask:

> Are we early enough to gain advantage — but late enough to reduce risk?



## Practical Application

Use EARLY signals to:
- Test low-budget creative experiments
- Introduce structural variation into briefs

Use ACCELERATING signals to:
- Deploy controlled scaling
- Diversify creative variants quickly

Avoid scaling into SATURATED signals without a strong differentiator.

Signals reward timing discipline.

Being first is risky.

Sitting on it is riskier.
