**Velocity can create urgency.**

Urgency can distort judgment.

When a signal is marked as accelerating, it does not mean “scale immediately.”

It means adoption is increasing faster than baseline.



## What Acceleration Actually Indicates

<ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
    <li>Increased cross-account repetition</li>
    <li>Broader platform placement</li>
    <li>Faster iteration cycles</li>
</ul>

It does not automatically mean improved CPA.



## Common Misuse

Teams often:

<ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
  <li>Reallocate too aggressively</li>
  <li>Drop existing high-performing formats</li>
  <li>Overproduce variants too quickly</li>
</ul>

Velocity signals opportunity — not guarantees.



## A Measured Response Framework

When a signal is accelerating:

1. Introduce 2–3 structured variants
2. Isolate performance against control
3. Monitor creative fatigue curves
4. Scale only when lift persists across cycles



## Why This Matters

Creative markets move faster than budget cycles.

Discipline prevents overreaction.

The goal is to expand your advantage — not chase it.

Acceleration rewards preparation.

Not panic.
